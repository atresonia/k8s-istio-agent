## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-23

### Added
- **Core Architecture**: Clean, enterprise-ready AI agent for Kubernetes and Istio troubleshooting
- **LLM Provider Support**: 
  - HuggingFace
  - Ollama
  - OpenAI - not tested
  - Azure OpenAI - not tested
  - Internal/enterprise LLM wrapper support - not tested
- **Tool System**:
  - Base tool abstractions
  - Tool registry for dynamic loading
  - Kubernetes tools (kubectl, logs, resources)
  - Istio tools (proxy status, config analysis) - not tested
  - Observability tools (placeholder)
- **User Interfaces**:
  - Interactive CLI mode
  - Web interface with FastAPI (not tested)
  - Single query mode (not tested)
- **Deployment Options** (not tested):
  - Local development setup
  - In-cluster Kubernetes deployment
  - Azure Container Instance support

### Technical Features
- **Memory Optimization**: 8-bit quantization support for local models
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-based architecture for tools and LLM providers
- **Testing Framework**: Unit and integration test structure
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with examples

### Current State / Limitations
- Istio tools are placeholder implementations and need testing/refactoring
- Observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana) are not yet implemented
- Limited test coverage for edge cases
- Only the CLI has been tested, web is just a placeholder for now
- Kubernetes tools have been tested, but the agent has not yet been programmed to extract the kubectl output (which is often bulky) into a more readable response. See [example-run.html](example-run.html) for an example run (as of 6/23).


### Roadmap
- [ ] Complete Istio tool implementations
- [ ] Add Prometheus and Grafana integration
- [ ] Implement advanced log analysis patterns
- [ ] Add support for custom troubleshooting workflows
- [ ] Enhance web UI with better styling and UX
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Implement caching for LLM responses
- [ ] Add support for multi-cluster environments
- [ ] Create Helm chart for easier deployment
- [ ] Add metrics and monitoring for the agent itself
